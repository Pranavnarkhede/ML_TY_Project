    'Potato___Early_blight': """ <b>Crop</b>: Potato <br/>Disease: Early Blight<br/>
        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1. Early blight (EB) is a disease of potato caused by the fungus Alternaria solani. It is found wherever potatoes are grown. 

        <br/> 2. The disease primarily affects leaves and stems, but under favorable weather conditions, and if left uncontrolled, can result in considerable defoliation and enhance the chance for tuber infection. Premature defoliation may lead to considerable reduction in yield.

        <br/> 3. Primary infection is difficult to predict since EB is less dependent upon specific weather conditions than late blight.
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Plant only diseasefree, certified seed. 

        <br/>2. Follow a complete and regular foliar fungicide spray program.
        
        <br/>3. Practice good killing techniques to lessen tuber infections.
        <br/>4. Allow tubers to mature before digging, dig when vines are dry, not wet, and avoid excessive wounding of potatoes during harvesting and handling.""",


    'Potato___healthy': """ <b>Crop</b>: Potato <br/>Disease: Late Blight<br/>

        Late blight is a potentially devastating disease of potato, infecting leaves, stems and fruits of plants. The disease spreads quickly in fields and can result in total crop failure if untreated.              
        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1. Late blight is caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. Oomycetes are fungus-like organisms also called water molds, but they are not true fungi.

        <br/> 2. There are many different strains of P. infestans. These are called clonal lineages and designated by a number code (i.e. US-23). Many clonal lineages affect both tomato and potato, but some lineages are specific to one host or the other.
        <br/> 3. The host range is typically limited to potato and tomato, but hairy nightshade (Solanum physalifolium) is a closely related weed that can readily become infected and may contribute to disease spread. Under ideal conditions, such as a greenhouse, petunia also may become infected.
        
        
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1.Seed infection is unlikely with commercially prepared potato seed or with saved seed that has been thoroughly dried.

        <br/>2.Before purchasing and/or planting potato transplants, inspect them for symptoms of late blight, especially if they are shipped from regions where the disease is prevalent.
        
        <br/>3. If infection is detected in only a few plants within a field, promptly remove and destroy infected plants to prevent the spread throughout the entire field. This can be done by discing-under, using herbicide, or flame-killing the infected plants.""",
